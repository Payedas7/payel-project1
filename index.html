    As much as video games are immersive and entertaining, video games are also a business and thus follow the rules of a business. This comes into play when seeing that major publishers who have more resources to put into marketing the video games during release dominate sales in all regions. We can also see that certain regions prefer certain genres of games as well as that the rating of a game can determine the sales quantity.
